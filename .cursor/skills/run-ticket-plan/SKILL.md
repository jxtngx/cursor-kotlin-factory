# Run ticket plan

After `@scrum-master` has written `.cursor/plans/project-init/<slug>-sprint.plan.md` and the user has approved it.

Implement **one** ticket at a time in TRACK order.
Honor `.cursor/rules/factory-implements.mdc` and `kotlin-compose.mdc`.
Stop after each ticket for `@review-kotlin` if the user wants a gate.
Do not expand scope onto another TRACK.
